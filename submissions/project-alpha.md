## Project Title
VaxFlow: AI‑Powered Vaccine Distribution Optimisation for Remote Regions

## Problem Statement
In low‑income countries, up to 50% of vaccines are wasted due to cold‑chain failures, inaccurate demand forecasting, and logistical bottlenecks. Rural communities in Sub‑Saharan Africa experience immunization coverage below 60%, leaving millions vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles, polio, and COVID‑19.

## Proposed Solution & Innovation
VaxFlow combines predictive AI with a lightweight IoT temperature‑monitoring device to optimise vaccine supply chains. The AI model ingests historical vaccination data, weather forecasts, and mobile‑network signals to predict demand at the clinic level. Solar‑powered IoT sensors track cold‑chain integrity in real time, alerting health workers before spoilage occurs. The innovation lies in its low‑cost, scalable integration of existing mobile infrastructure and open‑source AI tools.

## Team Expertise
- Dr. Aisha Mbeki (Lead): 10 years in public‑health logistics with WHO.
- Engineer Kwame Osei (Tech Lead): Former Nokia engineer, specialist in low‑power IoT.
- Data Scientist Li Wei: PhD in machine learning, previously at Google AI for Social Good.
- Community Coordinator Fatoumata Diallo: Founder of a women‑led health‑worker network in Mali.

## Budget Summary
- Personnel (4 FTEs for 12 months): $240,000
- IoT device prototyping & manufacturing: $80,000
- Cloud computing & AI model training: $30,000
- Field pilot in 3 districts (travel, per‑diems): $40,000
- Dissemination & stakeholder workshops: $10,000
**Total requested: $400,000 USD**

## Expected Impact on Prevention
- Reduce vaccine wastage by at least 40% in pilot districts.
- Increase immunization coverage by 25% within 12 months.
- Enable early detection of cold‑chain breaches, preventing 10,000+ spoiled doses annually.
- Create a replicable model that can be adopted by national immunisation programmes across 10+ countries.

## Timeline
- Months 1‑3: Design finalisation, IoT prototype development.
- Months 4‑6: AI model training & integration with local health data.
- Months 7‑9: Pilot deployment in 3 districts, training of health workers.
- Months 10‑12: Data collection, impact evaluation, scaling plan.

## Additional Notes
We have a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Health in Ghana for pilot access. A preliminary prototype of the temperature sensor has been tested in a lab setting with 99.8% accuracy.
