## Project Title
Resilient Supply Chain: Blockchain‑Enabled Tracking of Essential Medicines in Conflict Zones

## Problem Statement
In fragile and conflict‑affected states, up to 70% of essential medicines never reach intended health facilities due to theft, diversion, or spoilage. The lack of transparent supply‑chain visibility prevents accountability and exacerbates shortages during epidemics, as seen in Yemen and South Sudan.

## Proposed Solution & Innovation
We propose a lightweight blockchain‑based tracking system that uses QR‑code labels on medicine packages. Each transaction (manufacturer → distributor → warehouse → clinic) is recorded on a permissioned blockchain, visible to authorised stakeholders (Ministries of Health, donors, NGOs). The innovation is the integration of low‑cost, offline‑capable handheld scanners that sync data when connectivity is available, ensuring functionality in areas with intermittent internet. The system also includes predictive analytics to flag potential stock‑outs.

## Team Expertise
- Supply Chain Specialist: Maria Rodriguez (former Director of Logistics, Médecins Sans Frontières).
- Blockchain Developer: Ahmed Khan (built supply‑chain solutions for IBM Food Trust).
- Conflict‑Zone Health Expert: Dr. Jean‑Paul Ndayishimiye (worked with WHO in DRC and Central African Republic).
- Data Analyst: Sophie Chen (specialises in humanitarian data visualisation).

## Budget Summary
- Development of blockchain platform & mobile scanning app: $200,000
- Procurement of 500 handheld scanners & QR‑code printers: $75,000
- Deployment & training in 3 conflict‑affected regions: $90,000
- Independent audit & security assessment: $25,000
- Operational support (12 months): $60,000
**Total requested: $450,000 USD**

## Expected Impact on Prevention
- Reduce medicine diversion by at least 50% in pilot regions.
- Cut stock‑out duration from an average of 30 days to <7 days.
- Enable real‑time accountability for $10M+ of donated medicines annually.
- Strengthen trust among donors, increasing future funding for health programs in fragile settings.

## Timeline
- Months 1‑3: Platform development, hardware procurement.
- Months 4‑6: Pilot deployment in 1 region (e.g., Northeast Nigeria).
- Months 7‑9: Expand to 2 additional regions, refine based on feedback.
- Months 10‑12: Full evaluation, handover to local health authorities.

## Additional Notes
We have letters of support from the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Global Fund, who are keen to pilot the system for their own supply chains. A proof‑of‑concept has been demonstrated with dummy data.
