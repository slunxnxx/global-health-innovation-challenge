## Project Title
Community Sentinel: Mobile‑First Syndromic Surveillance for Early Outbreak Detection

## Problem Statement
Traditional disease surveillance in low‑resource settings relies on paper‑based reporting, causing delays of weeks before outbreaks are identified. During the 2023 cholera outbreak in Zambia, it took 21 days for official alerts to reach national health authorities, resulting in over 5,000 preventable cases.

## Proposed Solution & Innovation
Community Sentinel is a lightweight mobile app that enables community health workers (CHWs) to report syndromic data (fever, diarrhea, respiratory symptoms) in real time using basic feature phones (SMS/USSD) and smartphones. The system uses natural‑language processing to extract key symptoms from voice notes in local languages, aggregates data on a dashboard with automated anomaly detection, and sends instant alerts to district health offices. Innovation: voice‑based reporting eliminates literacy barriers, and offline‑first design works without continuous internet.

## Team Expertise
- Dr. Carlos Mendez (Epidemiologist): 15 years with CDC in outbreak response.
- Software Engineer Priya Sharma: Lead developer at Ushahidi, expert in low‑bandwidth mobile platforms.
- Dr. Ngozi Okonjo (Public Health): Former Minister of Health, Nigeria, now advisor to Africa CDC.
- Data Engineer Tomasz Kowalski: Built real‑time dashboards for WHO’s Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network.

## Budget Summary
- Development & maintenance of mobile platform (12 months): $180,000
- Field training for 500 CHWs across 2 countries: $60,000
- Server costs & SMS gateway fees: $25,000
- Evaluation & impact assessment by independent third party: $35,000
- Contingency for unforeseen scaling needs: $20,000
**Total requested: $320,000 USD**

## Expected Impact on Prevention
- Reduce time‑to‑detection of outbreaks from weeks to <48 hours.
- Enable early containment of epidemics, potentially preventing 50,000+ cases per major outbreak.
- Empower 500+ CHWs with digital tools, improving their effectiveness and motivation.
- Generate open‑source surveillance software that can be adopted by any country’s Ministry of Health.

## Timeline
- Months 1‑2: Finalise app design, develop core features.
- Months 3‑4: Pilot in 20 health facilities in Malawi and Uganda.
- Months 5‑8: Scale to 500 CHWs, integrate with national health systems.
- Months 9‑12: Continuous monitoring, impact evaluation, handover planning.

## Additional Notes
We have already secured partnership with the Malawi Ministry of Health and a local telecom provider for zero‑rated SMS. A prototype app has been tested with 50 CHWs, showing 94% satisfaction rate.
