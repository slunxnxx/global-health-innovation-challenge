# Global Health Innovation Challenge

## Mission
To fund bold ideas that prevent the next epidemic through innovative approaches to disease prevention, early warning systems, and resilient health systems.

## Key Funding Criteria
We seek projects that align with the following priorities:

1. **Immunisation and Vaccine Equity** – Innovations that expand access, improve delivery, or increase uptake of life‑saving vaccines.
2. **Early Warning & Surveillance Systems** – Tools that detect outbreaks faster, integrate real‑time data, and enable rapid response.
3. **Citizen‑Led Health Monitoring** – Solutions that empower communities to monitor health risks, report symptoms, and engage in prevention.
4. **Health System Resilience** – Approaches that strengthen primary care, supply chains, and workforce capacity in low‑resource settings.
5. **Smart Innovation** – Technology‑driven ideas (AI, mobile platforms, diagnostics) that are scalable, cost‑effective, and sustainable.
